              Iâ€™m a passionate web developer focused on creating efficient,
              user-friendly applications, especially with React. I hold a Master
              of IT from Charles Sturt University and a Bachelor's in Computer
              Engineering from Pokhara University. My hands-on skills were
              sharpened through the Web Development Professional Year at QIBA
              and the Job Ready Program at Dented Code Academy, where I worked
              with JavaScript, React, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express. I'm now
              ready to contribute to innovative and impactful web projects.
